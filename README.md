# Bbyrobot's 100 Days of Code 
I'm following along with [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 with Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?referralCode=00555B4B1F6FC1A84FBC) on Udemy

### Day 1 - May 14th, 2022

I made a little [band name generator](https://replit.com/@bbyrobot/band-name-generator-start#main.py)

Since according to Angela's quiz I'm at more of an intermediate level I may do more complex projects sooner. 
We shall see. 

### Day 2 - May 15th, 2022

Did some variable type conversion. Learned about the f-string which was a nice little trick I didn't know about before. 

Made a [tip calculator](https://replit.com/@bbyrobot/tip-calculator-end#main.py) for the final project of the day. It was fun.
I really appreciate these refreshers. It's nice to know that I know what I'm doing. 

### Day 3 - May 17th, 2022

Started on the 16th 2022.

I reviewed if statements today and I'm not even gonna lie I learned a ton of new stuff about them.
I did some nested if statements and multiple if statements which I honestly wasn't even aware was posssible but I'm glad to know now.

All of the indents in this [Treasure Island Game](https://replit.com/@bbyrobot/treasure-island-start?v=1#main.py) beat my ASS.
I was beating my head against the wall trying to get this to get this to run for hours all to realize it was because I forgot to put the parantheses at the end of the lower() method. smh It's always the little things. 

### Day 4 - May 18th, 2022
Today was chill. Did some nested lists. Made a [Rock, Paper, Scissors Game](https://replit.com/@bbyrobot/rock-paper-scissors-start#main.py). This one was fun. I love me some RPS =] This is when I realized that I'll have to strengthen my thinking outside of the box skills so I don't make things more complicated than they need to be by maybe adding more elif statements before realizing you there are maybe one or two statements that I can write to cover everything. Hopefully with more practice I can learn to write more concise code. 

## Day 5 - May 20th, 2022
Started for loops yesterday and I FINALLY understand them lol. I've been having trouble with for loops since I initially got into coding last year and they were finally explained in a way that clicked for me. Got Fizzbuzz on the FIRST TRY ya'll. I feel like a gotdamn superhero now. lol Final project was a [Password Generator](https://replit.com/@bbyrobot/password-generator-start#main.py) which EVERYONE needs these days so I'm very proud of that. I only had to do some quick googles for the shuffling at it was great!
