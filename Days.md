# 100 Days of Code - by bbyrobot
I'm following along with [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 with Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?referralCode=00555B4B1F6FC1A84FBC) on Udemy

### Day 1 - May 14th, 2022

I made a little [band name generator](https://replit.com/@bbyrobot/band-name-generator-start#main.py)

Since I might be at a more intermediate level I may do more complex projects sooner. 
We shall see. 

### Day 2 - May 15th, 2022

Did some variable type conversion. Learned about the f-string which was a nice little trick I didn't know about before. 

Made a [tip calculator](https://replit.com/@bbyrobot/tip-calculator-end#main.py) for the final project of the day. It was fun.
I really appreciate these refreshers. It's nice to know that I know what I'm doing. 

### Day 3 - May 16th, 2022

I reviewed if statements today and I'm not even gonna lie I learned a shit ton of new stuff about them.
I did some nested if statements and multiple if statements which I honestly wasn't even aware was posssible but I'm glad to know now.
